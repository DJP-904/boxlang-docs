# How are BoxLang+ Containers Licensed?

BoxLang+ is licensed on a per-orchestrator-node basis, regardless of the orchestrator you use. If you use 3 or 10 nodes to deploy 1,000,000 containers, you only license the nodes. You decide how many containers you want to deploy on each orchestrator node.

Development nodes are always **FREE**, and non-production nodes are at 50% of the normal price.

**FREEDOM TO SCALE!**
