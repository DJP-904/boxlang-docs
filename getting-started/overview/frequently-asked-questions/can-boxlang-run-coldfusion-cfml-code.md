# Can BoxLang run ColdFusion/CFML code?

BoxLang supports a dual parser and compiler that can execute ColdFusion/CFML code natively (maybe more languages later). This means that you can run all your ColdFusion applications within BoxLang natively. We also provide tooling to automatically transpile your ColdFusion code to BoxLang as well.

There are cases where specific Adobe or Lucee functionality might not exist in BoxLang. However, BoxLang is built modularly and these missing features can be created and supported via our BoxLang+ subscriptions. [www.boxlang.io/coldfusion](http://www.boxlang.io/coldfusion)
