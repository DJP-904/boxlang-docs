# How are BoxLang+ Containers Licensed?

BoxLang+ is licensed on a per-orchestrator-node basis, no matter the orchestrator you use. If you use 3 or 10 nodes to deploy 1000000 containers, you only license the nodes. How many containers you want to deploy on each orchestrator node is up to you.

Development nodes are always FREE, and non-production nodes are at 50% of the normal price.

**FREEDOM TO SCALE!**
