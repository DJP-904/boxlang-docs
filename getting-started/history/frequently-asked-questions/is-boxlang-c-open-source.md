# Is BoxLang© open-source?

BoxLang© is a professional open-source project based on the Apache 2 license. Ortus Solutions supports every aspect of the language, and you can get a BoxLang+ subscription for professional support, extended features, and modular capabilities. You can use the BoxLang open-source edition to create and deploy commercial software without paying a single cent. We love open-source; we breathe open-source. We also know that it comes with responsibilities. Your support matters to us and the project. That’s why we offer a BoxLang+ subscription so you can support further language development. You can also become a Patreon and partner with us so we can ALWAYS keep the language accessible and open-source.
