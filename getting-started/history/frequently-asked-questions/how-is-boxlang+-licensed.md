# How is BoxLang+ Licensed?

We don’t look at cores, memory, where it’s deployed, how you use it, or even how much money you make. We care that this language exists, can be maintained, and can power your applications with high performance and world-class support. That’s why our licensing model is based on being fair and following the golden rule: Do to others as you want them to do to you.

Every BoxLang+ subscription covers a single production server on a physical or virtual machine or cloud lambdas. Every development usage is included for FREE. Every non-production instance is included at 50% of the regular price. You can have as many instances of the language running on each machine.

If you are using lambdas, we require 1 license, and you can run as many lambdas as you want.

Every subscription is used to maintain and further extend the language. Your support matters to this project.

**FREEDOM TO SCALE!**
