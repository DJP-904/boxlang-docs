# File Handling

Boxlang allows you to manipulate, read, upload, etc files via its built in methods which are great and easy to use. It can even help you manipulate zip/jar archives!  We won't go into every single detail of file handling, but below you can find the majority of functions to deal with file handling. 

{% hint style="success" %}
You can find the file system functions here: [https://cfdocs.org/filesystem-functions](https://cfdocs.org/filesystem-functions).
{% endhint %}

* [FileWriteLine](https://docs.lucee.org/reference/functions/filewriteline.html) Opens up the file \(or uses the existing file object\) and appends the given line of text
* [GetFileInfo](https://docs.lucee.org/reference/functions/getfileinfo.html) Retrieves information about file.
* [GetFreeSpace](https://docs.lucee.org/reference/functions/getfreespace.html) Returns the number of unallocated bytes in the partition named by this abstract path name.
* [GetTempDirectory](https://docs.lucee.org/reference/functions/gettempdirectory.html) Returns the full path to the currently assigned temporary directory
* [GetTempFile](https://docs.lucee.org/reference/functions/gettempfile.html) Creates a temporary file in a directory whose name starts with \(at most\) the first three characters of prefix.
* [ImageWrite](https://docs.lucee.org/reference/functions/imagewrite.html) Writes a image to the specified filename or destination.

```java
// A few examples
content = fileRead( expandPath( "/config/myfile.txt" ) );
if( fileExists( "filepath.txt" ) ){

}
fileDelete( "filepath.txt" )
fileWrite( getTempFile( getTempDirectory(), "tempFile"), "My Data" );

directoryList( "/my/path" )
directoryExists( "/my/path" )

<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="fileInput">
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>

<cfscript>
  if( structKeyExists( form, "fileInput" )) {
    try {
      uploadedFile = fileUpload( getTempDirectory(), "fileInput", "image/jpeg,image/pjpeg", "MakeUnique" );
      // check the file extension of the uploaded file; mime types can be spoofed
      if (not listFindNoCase("jpg,jpeg", cffile.serverFileExt)) {
      throw("The uploaded file is not of type JPG.");
      }
      // do stuff with uploadedFile...
    } catch ( coldfusion.tagext.io.FileUtils$InvalidUploadTypeException e ) {
      writeOutput( "This upload form only accepts JPEG files." );
    }
    catch (any e) {
      writeOutput( "An error occurred while uploading your file: #e.message#" );
    }
  }
</cfscript>

```

## Dealing With Large Files

If you want to read or manipulate large files we would recommend that you leverage our [cbStreams](https://forgebox.io/view/cbstreams) library or native Java file streaming.  Below you can find some sample usage of reading large files with [cbStreams](https://forgebox.io/view/cbstreams) which implements the Java Streams API.

```java
stream = streamBuilder.new().ofFile( absolutePath );
try{
    //work on the stream of lines of files and close it in the finally block
} finally{
    stream.close();
}

//You can even process file lines concurrently
stream = streamBuilder.new()
    .parallel()
    .ofFile( absolutePath );
```
