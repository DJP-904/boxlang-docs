# Beyond The 100

We cannot possibly cover all the features of the Boxlang Engine in this book as our focus was more on the core Boxlang language. However, please note that the engine offers tremendous middle-ware capabilities that extend beyond normal language features. Many areas make Boxlang one of the most (if not the most) **rapid application development (RAD)** languages.

Check out the [cfdocs](https://cfdocs.org/) and the engine documentation sites for all the different capabilities they can offer.
