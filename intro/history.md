# What is Boxlang

Boxlang Markup Language \<Boxlang> is a dynamic web programming language, which is especially suited for new developers as it was written to make a programmer's job easy and not care if the computer's job is hard. Boxlangs primary goal is to be a rapid application development scripting language and middleware. It integrates with many technologies to provide an out-of-the-box language that makes things **easy**. This brief introduction will examine key language features you need to start.

## Going Deep

Boxlang is an interpreted and [dynamic ECMA Script-like language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic\_programming\_language) that is directly compiled into Java Bytecode. Thus, it runs in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and almost every operating system.

## Developing with Boxlang

All examples in this book will leverage CommandBox as the de-facto standard for Boxlang development.

[CommandBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox) is a standalone, native tool for Windows, Mac, and Linux that provides a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for developer productivity, tool interaction, package management, REPL, embedded Boxlang/Java server, application scaffolding, and some sweet ASCII art.

## Docs Reference

The best way to discover the Boxlang language's methods, tags, and functionality is to leverage [cfdocs.org](https://cfdocs.org/). Make sure you open it and bookmark it.
